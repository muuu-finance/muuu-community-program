Introduction of Muuu-Community-Program

## Muuu

### Overview

Muuu is a non-custodial lending protocol on Astar Network. Depositors can provide liquidity to earn interest as a stable passive income, while borrowers can leverage their assets without selling them out.

Astar Network aims to be the biggest hub for the multi-chain era by bridging with Ethereum, Cosmos, and others. With Muuu Finance, the Astar ecosystem will be a huge marketplace for storing all kinds of tokens on any kinds of chains.

In order to accelerate Muuu ecosystem, we need your help. Therefore, we are looking for active members of the community to help promote and raise awareness of Muuu and Astar Network. Community managers will become official representatives of Muuu and will play an important role in creating the future of Muuu and its ecosystem.

## Criteria

- Our community program is in principle compliant with Astar's program.
Therefore, it is better if you understand Astar and have participated in Astar ambassador program.But if you have never participated in this program, you are still eligible to apply,so go ahead and apply!
(In this case,we hope that you will learn about Astar, our protocol, as you participate.)
- Experience with community engagement on social media (Telegram, Discord, meetups).
- Engaged in Muuu community.

We hope that the Astar ecosystem will become more active through Muuu and community program.
Therefore, we would be more than happy if you would consider understanding Astar and contributing to the Astar community within our community program!

For more information about the task, please see "Program Contents" below.

## Benefits

     (You can even take the tokens you've earned and add more on Muuu!)

- Build a reputation (and maybe even your future career!) for yourself!

You will have the opportunity to communicate with people who have experience in crypto-marketing and financial systems.

## Roles
### Candidate -> Community Manager -> Regional Head

As for the roles, in principle, we follow Astar's ambassador program.
Therefore, you will start as a Candidate. 

We will review your commitment and progress in the first two months and decide if you are ready to take on the responsibility as a community manager.
As a rule, the tasks that need to be performed by Candidates and Community Manager remain the same. However, when you are promoted to Community Manager, you will receive bonus tokens in addition to the basic rewards. The bonus amount and rewards are still being worked out.

If you gain experience as a community manager over a certain period of time and show high commitment and performance, you will be promoted to Regional Head and will receive an additional bonus. (The amount of the bonus and the role of Regional Head are still being worked out)

## Program Contents

In principle, we follow Astar's New Program.

・There will be basic tasks and supplementary tasks every month.

- Supplementary tasks are optional but **should be done at least once a month**.
- There is no upper limit to the number of tasks you can do, so you can do as many as you like. For example, it is OK to do the same task more than once.
- Each task is given specific points and you need to achieve at least 50% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
- If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
- If we have extra MUUU tokens, they are often carried over to the next month.
<!-- -  Is this part right?-->
- We will run this program for 4 months on a trial basis. The start date will be at the time of release and the end date will be 4 months after the release.
- If you fail to earn 50% of the points in both of the two month Candidate periods, you will be required to exit the community program.
- We are still working on the reward pool. For us, our mission is to contribute to the Astar ecosystem, and we are looking at designs that will contribute the most to Astar.
